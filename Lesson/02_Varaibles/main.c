/*
A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area
that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has
a specific type, which determines the size and layout of
the variable's memory; the range of values that can be
stored within that memory; and the set of operations that
 can be applied to the variable.

The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits,
and the underscore character. It must begin with either a
letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are
distinct because C is case-sensitive. Based on the basic
types explained in the previous chapter, there will be
the following basic variable types
